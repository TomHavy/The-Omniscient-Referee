#### **[This project serves as a demonstration of the new and powerful Mistral 7B Instruct model on a fully open-source and scalable stack]**

### ðŸš€ Overview
The Omniscient Referee is a specialized chatbot designed to provide expert answers to NBA basketball-related questions and scenarios. The value of this product lies in the fact that in real-life situations, referees cannot access the rule book in real time. Here, with the official rule book in context, the bot can provide more accurate and unbiased answers.

### ðŸ“Š Key Components:
- **Mistral 7b:** A recent cutting-edge 7.3 billion parameter model that even outperforms larger models on various benchmarks. It excels in English tasks and code-related tasks, featuring Grouped-query attention (GQA) for swift inference and Sliding Window Attention (SWA) for efficient handling of longer sequences. Best of all, it's open-source under the Apache 2.0 license, granting unrestricted access.
  
- **Haystack**: An open-source framework that simplifies the development of production-ready applications. It provides a seamless experience for leveraging the latest Large Language Models (LLMs), like Mistral 7B, for various tasks. With Haystack, you can effortlessly manage preprocessing, pipelines, agents, and evaluation. Plus, it offers flexibility in choosing databases, from Elasticsearch to Weaviate, allowing you to scale up to handle millions of documents with ease.
  
- **Elastic Search**: ES is a NoSQL database and search engine that stores its documents in a decentralized manner, distributing them over several nodes. Developers love ES for its ease of use, scalability, and the speed with which it returns keyword-based search results, even from large datasets. But did you know that you could leverage the latest Transformer models to add semantic search capabilities to your ES index?
  
- **Streamlit**: Is an open-source Python library, that simplifies the development of user-friendly web applications. It seamlessly integrates with this tech stack, without the need for extensive web development expertise.
